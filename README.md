# Phaser 3 Blackjack Game

This is a simple Blackjack game built using Phaser 3. The game allows a player to play against a dealer, following standard Blackjack rules.

## Features

- **Dynamic Deck**: A shuffled deck of cards is created at the start of the game.
- **Player Actions**: The player can "Hit" to draw a card or "Stand" to end their turn.
- **Dealer Logic**: The dealer automatically draws cards until their total is at least 17 or they bust.
- **Hand Values**: The current hand values for both the player and the dealer are displayed in real-time.
- **Restart Option**: A "Click to Continue" button allows the player to restart the game after it ends.

## How to Play

1. Click the "Play" button to start the game.
2. The player and dealer are each dealt one card.
3. Use the "Hit" button to draw additional cards or the "Stand" button to end your turn.
4. The dealer will automatically draw cards until their total is at least 17 or they bust.
5. The winner is determined based on the hand values:
   - If the player's total exceeds 21, they bust, and the dealer wins.
   - If the dealer's total exceeds 21, they bust, and the player wins.
   - Otherwise, the higher total wins. If both totals are equal, it's a tie.
